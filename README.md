# weatherapp  
This is a small app that allows the user to search for the weather in a city of their choice.  

##What the app does
The functionality is quite straight forward; the home screen shows an input field into which the user types a city name, such as London or San Diego.  
There are then two options; see the current temperature or select the five-day temperature forecast.  
In each screen, the user can return to the home page to choose another location.  
The five-day forecast shows the actual, max, and minimum temperatures forecast for the city plus a summary for the five days; maximum, minimum and average.

##Why build the app?
